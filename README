This program is free software, and the output to image part depends on Graphviz: 
    http://www.graphviz.org

Description: C Include Graph is a program that takes a path to a directory of C/C++ 
source files and outputs a digraph where the nodes are source files, and 
the edges are "includes" relations.

Example: 
    $ incgrph.py <path>
    digraph <path> 
    {
        foo.cpp -> bar.h
        ...
        baz.cpp -> goa.h -> phi.h
    }

Optional: you can feed the -i flag to incgrph.py to output a png file of the digraph.

Note: 
To check whether you have it [graphviz] installed, open a terminal and type 
"dot", if you get something other than "command not found" then it is installed.
